save_as: index.html

My name is Devin Schwab. I'm currently a masters student at Case
Western Reserve University studying Computer Science. My research
focuses on machine learning and artificial intelligence --
specifically reinforcement learning. My current thesis research is
focused on hierarchical approaches to reinforcement learning. I am
interested in applying machine learning techniques in the field of
robotics in the hopes of making more useful autonomous robots.

I have experience working on real robotics systems. I spent a year as
a researcher at the University of Hong Kong working on the DARPA
Robotics Challenge. I also have experience with radio communications
from my work at the NASA Glenn Research Center.

I have lots experiences living and travelling in other countries. I
have been on exchanges and study abroads in Tokyo, Japan. While there
I studied Japanese language, so I have intermediate fluency in the
language. As mentioned I have also lived in Hong Kong for a year.

questions please feel free to contact me.
